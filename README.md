**My name is Daniel Manera.**
Graphic design has become more than a hobby for me over the past few years, and I have _really_ started to enjoy learning more in-depth lessons on how to become a stronger designer. I believe that hard work can get you a lot of places and I believe that's why I'm in this class today. I hope to grow my design skills further over the next 2 years, and hopefully I never stop learning even past that. Like John Wooden said:
